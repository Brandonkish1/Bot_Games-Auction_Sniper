## Use Case

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvFuZoLXj2I

Win an auction by entering a bid at the last possible second. The auction page has a random time remaining for bidding to close. The bot has to be dynamic enough to account for the varying times. There will also be another bidder entering a bid, so the goal is to bid at the very end. 

## Approach
Launch the website and enter the a bid of $10 more than the previous bid. Click the quick bid button and then capture how many seconds are remaining. I converted the seconds to milliseconds and calculated how long I wanted to wait before finalizing the bid. After delaying for the wait period click the place bid button to enter the bid.
