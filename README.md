# Bot Games - Auction Sniper Challenge

## Use Case

Win an auction by entering a bid at the last possible second. The auction page has a random time remaining for bidding to close. The bot has to be dynamic enough to account for the varying times. There will also be another bidder entering a bid, so the goal is to bid at the very end.
